Creating self-signed certificate to allow VSCode to run http requests on remote server-
    # create key and cert
    openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout key.pem -x509 -days 365 -out certificate.pem
    # combine key and cert
    openssl pkcs12 -inkey key.pem -in certificate.pem -export -out certificate.p12

    Downloaded certificate.p12 to my local computer, and then adding to Chrome: chrome://settings/privacy > Manage certificates > Import > Select and import certificate.p12 > Restarting VS Code.
